# Kr-Data

I made this [website](http://kr-data.netlify.com) for people to use when [Cleo Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kings_Raid/comments/7fmu40/introducing_discord_bot_cleo/) was down. [Mask of Goblin](https://maskofgoblin.com/hero/1) wasn't up to date back then but now it's regularly updated so use that instead. Made the repository public for people who want to see how bad I am with frontend development.
